## Introduction
My research focuses on exploring the potential of AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), to simulate human-like behavior and interactions. Inspired by the concept of **Generative Agents**, I am to create AI systems that can autonomously plan, reflect, and adapt their actions in dynamic environments. These agents hold promise for applications ranging from immersive virtual worlds to automation and human-computer interaction.

Recently, I have been particularly intrigued by the idea of applying LLM-based agents to **fantasy settings**. By training these agents on fictional world-building data, they could learn the rules, lore, and characters of a fantasy universe. This approach could enable dynamic storytelling, emergent narratives, and more engaging interactions within games or virtual environments.

## Interest Research Topics
1. **Human Behavior Simulation with LLMs**  
   Developing agents that replicate realistic human behaviors using memory, planning, and reflection mechanisms.

2. **Fantasy World Simulation with LLM Agents**  
   Investigating how LLM agents can be trained on fictional settings to act as intelligent NPCs or dynamic storytellers in fantasy worlds. These agents could adapt to player choices, generate unique narratives, and enrich game experiences by understanding and interacting within a specific lore.

3. **AI-Driven Automation**  
   Utilizing LLMs to automate complex workflows and decision-making processes in interactive systems.

4. **Human-AI Interaction**  
   Enhancing user experience through believable AI agents capable of meaningful social interactions across diverse applications.

I believe that AI can revolutionize the realm of literature and fiction. I haven't studied this research topic in depth yet, but I'd like to learn more about it professionally if I get the chance.
